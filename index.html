            <p>I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. 
                Always give without remembering and always receive without forgetting. 
                Giving does not only precede receiving; it is the reason for it. 
                It's easier to take than to give.
                No one has ever become poor from giving.</p>
